The first task in fourth semester of programming course at my uni. The task was to implement 
a data structure in C, and I picked red-black trees. 

The requirements for the program are like this:
  - Automatic building, i.e. via make
  - Automatic testing, I opted Google Test famework
  - Line coverage should be at least 95%
  - No memory leaks, valgrind must be quiet as a lamb
